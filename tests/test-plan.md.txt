     markdown
## Bug Summary

Use GitHub Issues or defect-log.md for logging. Keep logs organized by page or date.

5️⃣ Jira / Kanban Setup
Using GitHub Projects:

Columns: To Do → In Progress → Review → Done

Cards: Assign each test flow, bug, or report section to teammates

Tags: Use labels like UI, form-validation, accessibility, dashboard

Teammates should update their cards daily to reflect activity.
